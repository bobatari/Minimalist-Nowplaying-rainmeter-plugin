Just kinda hated all the clutter in all these now playing plugins.

Figured I'd make myself something minimal but nice. 

So this is dynamic in very small ways. Uses elements from https://github.com/keifufu/WebNowPlaying-Rainmeter/releases/tag/2.0.7

the real hero ^ 

I just moved stuff and changed stuff

It's just the album art, and the title and artist are at the top in the middle

The pause button changes to play when being used, they all have highlights so you can hover over them

and there's a progress bar. 

Thats it. Super simple. 

So download this, install it, whatevs.
